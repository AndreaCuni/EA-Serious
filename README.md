Our goal is to create one of the most famous minigames in 2D of the 70s, 
PONG!<br>
We were inspired by the PONG video game, a sports arcade game that simulates table tennis in 2D.<br>
PONG was born in the 70s bringing to the market the first console in history.
###### sudo apt update: we inspire the past to look to the future.
This project is done in collaboration with IIT, the Italian Institute of Technology.

# The team
We are Italian students who attend the ITIS "Mario Delpozzo", classes "4A section: computer science" and "4A section: robotics". We work together to achieve better results
